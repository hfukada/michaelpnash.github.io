      <li>
        Making <i>unnecessary compromises</i> between speed of delivery and quality?

        Being driven down to the <i>lowest common denominator?</i>

        Seeing projects fail for entirely <em>avoidable</em> reasons?
      </li>
      <li>
        Having to <i>justify</i> doing things the right way?
      </li>
      <li>
        Defending the value of taking time to reduce technical debt?
      </li>
      <li>
        Seeing your team deliver code you&#8217;re <i>embarrassed</i> by, and feeling like you are the only one that cares?

    Is it just that software is really that hard? Are we doing something wrong &#8212; using the wrong tools, the wrong process? Or is it something more?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em><strong>Do you wonder why most software projects fail?</strong></em> Conservatively, it&#8217;s estimated that 50% of software projects fail, substantially or completely, 17% fail so badly they threaten the existence of their company.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This failure rate would be considered a <i>massive</i> crisis in most industries, and yet somehow it gets tolerated as business as usual in the software industry. If this was the construction industry we&#8217;d all be terrified to ever go indoors!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Does it have to be this way? <em>I don&#8217;t believe it does.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14px;">Many organizations think they can hire nine women to have a baby in one month, or that making it &#8220;easier&#8221; to program via &#8220;standardization&#8221; will result in better systems and lower costs, or that just adopting the right &#8220;methodology&#8221; will make everything better. If you know they&#8217;re wrong, </span><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">you probably fit the definition of </span><strong style="font-size: 14px;">software craftsmen</strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">. Much has been written about craftsmanship and what it means, but what do craftsmen </span><i style="font-size: 14px;">do</i><span style="font-size: 14px;">, and what do they </span><i style="font-size: 14px;">believe</i><span style="font-size: 14px;"> that sets them apart from other developers?</span></span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;ve had the good fortune to work in the software business for a long time, and in that time I&#8217;ve worked with many people who I consider to be craftsmen (and craftswomen) of the highest caliber. I&#8217;ve gathered the observations of what these individuals consider their underlying principles and practices into my new e-book <strong><i>Principles and Practices of Software Craftsmanship</i></strong>.

        The software craftsmanship movement is grass-roots effort to recognize what differentiates the masters of the software business, to identify and promote the practices that deliver on the promise of manifold increases in effectiveness and quality in an otherwise unpredictable industry.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Those that follow many of these principles on a daily basis know they still have much to learn, and sharing these principles and practices is part of my effort to promote that exchange of knowledge.

        This is a book for anyone frustrated with the abysmal state of most of the software business, for those that <em>know</em> we can do better, but aren&#8217;t sure where to start or how to sell it to their employers or clients.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you are a new software developer, and you care about your craft, you can jump-start your experience by studying the beliefs and activities of the most dedicated and experienced men and women in the business.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you are a seasoned developer who is perhaps losing that spark that made software <i>fun</i> back when you first started, and perhaps are even thinking of leaving the field, you will find here the way to take your development beyond your current level, ways to relight the spark by reconnecting with those basics that made software call to you originally.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you want to take your development abilities and those of your team beyond just the technology, then this book shows you how, and tells you how others have done it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you&#8217;re in a team where you feel like everyone else just accepts that most software has to be crap, get this book: it shows the way out of that hole.

        I&#8217;m Michael Nash. I&#8217;ve been building software professionally for about thirty-one years. I&#8217;ve had the chance to build a lot of software, and to work with some great developers along the way. I&#8217;ve worked on projects from accounting systems to artificial intelligence, as a self-employed consultant in several countries.

      <p>
        My book is an insider&#8217;s look at software craftsmanship, written for everyone on the path to excellence in the creation of qualify software.
