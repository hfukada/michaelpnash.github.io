You might be able to find it here.<br /> I agree with most of what it has to say, unfortunately. It&#8217;s unfortunate because basically it says our industry is pretty screwed up, and not really get much better.<br /> There are two things we &#8230;

        <a href="http://jglobal.com/ritual/" title="The Ritual">The Ritual</a> At the SCNA conference this year, the idea came up several times that a lot of software development, at least at an expert level, is done via &#8220;tacit knowledge&#8221;. That refers to that part of our understanding that is more automatic than effortful.<br /> An analogy to driving a car is helpful &#8211; most of us, &#8230;

        <a href="http://jglobal.com/rewrite-trap/" title="The Rewrite Trap">The Rewrite Trap</a> Software developers often consider a rewrite when problems with an existing application accumulate. This is usually the wrong approach, and I&#8217;ve seen many projects fail when trying it. Here we discuss the problems and an alternative.

        <a href="http://jglobal.com/fixing-scalability-later/" title="Fixing Scalability Later">Fixing Scalability Later</a> There&#8217;s a common wisdom that the right way to build a software product is to build the simplest thing that can work. In the user-facing world, it&#8217;s a bit different, there&#8217;s the concept of a minimum viable product, but that&#8217;s still what you build first.<br /> The understanding most developers have of what that means is that &#8230;

        <a href="http://jglobal.com/slow-down-and-think/" title="Slow Down and Think">Slow Down and Think</a> Modern software development sometimes allows us to build things faster than we can think about what we&#8217;re building. Fast feedback is important, but taking time to reason about what we&#8217;re building is even more essential.

        <a href="http://jglobal.com/technical-debt-bankruptcy/" title="Technical Debt Bankruptcy">Technical Debt Bankruptcy</a> Technical debt tends to increase the cost (in time, a.k.a money) to add each new feature or change to your system. Over time, this cost climbs, usually not steadily or regularly, but in an inexorable path that makes each new change a bit harder than it should be. Often this leads to taking shortcuts, applying &#8230;

This post is an overview of some of the better Git tutorials, including the more advanced ones that can take your Git-fu to the next level.

        <a href="http://jglobal.com/introduction-to-software-craftsmanship/" title="Introduction to Software Craftsmanship">Introduction to Software Craftsmanship</a> In my observations, I&#8217;ve noticed two different kinds of professional developers: Those for whom software is a job, a thing they do between nine and five, a skill they know how to perform, and that they perform in order to get paid.<br /> The other group doesn&#8217;t seem to think of software development as a job &#8230;

After all this musing, I&#8217;ve realized that the topic is large enough and important enough to explore more deeply.<br /> As many in the industry have observed, software is getting (arguably, already is) incredibly important &#8230;

While I can go on at length (as my colleagues can attest!) about how this is avoidable by baking in quality, and thus saving time and money at every turn, the fact is that &#8230;

By assembling a powerful set of tools you can make your Scala development quick and efficient, and get many other jobs done faster too. Emacs and Scala are a great fit together, in this post we&#8217;ll explain how I&#8217;ve assembled a combination of tools for fast Scala work.
