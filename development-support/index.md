Imagine having an expert Scala developers in the chair right next to you whenever you need them.

You have a problem, a question, or a piece of design in your code you&#8217;re just not sure about, and you can turn to someone who&#8217;s been there, in the trenches, who knows how to do it right.

Our development support team can do that, with our expertise in remote development, distributed teams and pairing tools, we can pair with your team members on an as-needed basis, and make sure they don&#8217;t waste any time on trial-and-error. We have a wide range of tools and techniques for remote pairing and development that let us be \*in\* your team, when we&#8217;re needed, without the delay and expense of on-site service.

</p>

<div class="toggle_container" style="display:none;">
  <div class="block">
    <p>
      If your team needs a hand with certain aspects of technologies or techniques that are new to them, our Developer on Demand service might be exactly what can help. Basically, this is a process whereby your company has an agreement with JGlobal that get you access to our development team to assist yours as-needed and when-needed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Your team gets access to a private online chat room and forum where they can ask questions when they come up &#8211; our team monitors and uses their experience to reply. As needed, we schedule remote pairing sessions with your team members (one-on-one or one-to-many, if it&#8217;s something the whole team needs to see), and use distributed development tools to share our screens and yours, working out the problem together.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We have shared repositories (git, subversion, Dropbox, and Google Drive for example) where code can be worked on collaboratively as needed to get you the results you need, as well as an array of cloud servers for testing and experimenting as needed.

</p>

<div class="toggle_container" style="display:none;">
  <div class="block">
    <p>
      All of our development support services begin with a service agreement between your organization and JGlobal, where we ensure confidentiality of your business and technical issues and artifacts, and where we establish what level of service you need, with what kind of lead time (for example, do you need to be able to get a developer on the line in 2 hours, or will the next day do?). Then we get your team access to our online tools where they can post issues, chat with our team (text and audio/video), and book time for specific one-on-one and one-on-many sessions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You pay a retainer-level fee to make sure our team is available, and are charged for what you use exactly, with detailed billing. You specify exactly who on your team is allowed to authorize billable services, so you have complete control at all times.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you just need us once or twice, we can do individual sessions without a long-term retainer as well, but our booking lead time is potentially longer in that case.
