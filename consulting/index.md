    <p>
      A fundamental principle of <a href="/software-craftsmanship/" target="_Got Javanew">software craftsmanship</a> is that the compromise between speed and quality is unnecessary and harmful. It doesn&#8217;t take longer to produce high-quality code, it takes <i>less</i> time to do it well the first time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We can work with your team to transform their development process to a <strong>high-speed, high-quality</strong> approach, <i>increasing</i> the rate of delivery of business value, all while <i>reducing</i> risk. Let us show you how.

      Sometimes you don&#8217;t need a long-term engagement, but need someone available to call to help with some portions of the development process, or to help solve a problem with a tool or a specific piece of code.

    <p>
      If you already have a design or architecture in mind, and want an expert analysis of that design, we can help. There are nuances of design in highly scalable and flexible systems that aren&#8217;t obvious early on, but can save a lot of effort and create a lot of value further on.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We can (confidentially, of course) review your architecture and design and give you additional confidence at any point in the development process, whether it&#8217;s a greenfield project or a large refactor.

    <p>
      <b>How does it work?</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you believe my company may be of service, I would be happy to provide a complimentary initial consultation to review your environment and needs. This process is typically done over the phone or via online video conferencing, and usually takes less than a day.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At this point I will prepare an engagement proposal, outlining the areas where Â improvement or enhancement will be evaluated, along with the results expected from those enhancements: For example, we might agree that your development practice for building new web applications is to be analyzed and potential enhancements identified.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The proposal will specify how the analysis will be performed and in what form the recommendations and proposed enhancements will be provided &#8211; this would typically include interviews and discussions with your development team, a review of your development and deployment infrastructure, and a review of your existing applications and plans for the near future.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My work is performed on a time and materials basis. The most efficient way for me to work is electronically, from my own offices. It is possible to make specific arrangements for on-site review as well, if this is indicated. Travel time and expenses are billable to the client, and clearly established ahead-of-time, eliminating any surprises.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The results of an initial analysis of the selected areas of your technology process are produced continually in an electronic form. You don&#8217;t just get a &#8220;finished report&#8221; at the end of the process, you have the opportunity to see valuable progress from day one, and we will review the progress regularly (at least once a week, preferably more) during the project.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      By the end of this phase we will have together identified areas where significant improvement is likely, and I will make specific proposals for achieving these improvements.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The next phase, should you decide to proceed to it, would be selection and prioritization of the enhancements. I would then prepare a detailed plan, outlining how the enhancements are to be tackled, who is involved, what the expected timeframes are, and, most importantly, where and when the benefits of the improvements can be measured. Once the plan begins, I again provide detailed progress indications on a constant basis &#8211; including measurements of the improvements being made all the way.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This means you see benefit right away, and can tell on a daily basis where progress is being made, allowing the plan to be fine-tuned as required during the enhancement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This phase might include upgrades to systems, rollouts and training for new tools or techniques, and/or pairing with your existing development team to bring them up to speed on a technology or approach.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As an example: Let&#8217;s say that an area of improvement is on the planning, tracking and visibility of development projects, and the proposed and accepted suggestion is to utilize the tool Pivotal Tracker to plan and execute a sprint-based development cycle, with a sprint length of one week. The process would be to work with the team to get the first sprints planned, to ensure they understand and can work with and easily access the tool, along with the benefits and significance of the specific features we want to take advantage of &#8211; for instance, the estimating and velocity calculations that Pivotal provides.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The metrics in this case might include the number of stories and tasks that have been planned, the team velocity, the number of developers converted to use the new tool, and so forth.

</p>

<div class="toggle_container" style="display:none;">
  <div class="block">
    <p>
      The software industry changes very quickly, which has both its downside and its upside. On the downside, most organizations can&#8217;t spend enough time to be familiar with the latest approach and tools available, and the pace of change can result in a lot of wasted time. A common reaction to this is to &#8220;throttle&#8221; change, by establishing standards in both technique and technology, limiting choice and focussing attention on a specific set of tools, with the hope of developing a critical mass of expertise in those tools.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The problem there is that you can miss the upside &#8211; new and better ways to get things done are constantly coming along, and the upside is that often those ways can provide significant efficiencies. You have to have enough information to make the correct decisions, however, and to avoid wasteful &#8220;thrashing&#8221; amongst different techniques and technologies.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I can review your software development or maintenance practices and tools and identify where a change in technique or technology can result in significant improvement, allowing your organization to get more done with less time and less effort.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The correct decisions in this area must include an awareness of your team&#8217;s capabilities, so that the cost of transitioning or adopting a new technology is taken into account. Often enhancing tools and techniques will have other indirect benefits &#8211; such as the opportunity to attract more experienced and efficient developers to your organization, or the chance to offer your existing developers an upward path for their own expertise, reducing turnover and improving morale.

### Onboarding Scala

If you&#8217;re adopting Scala or thinking about it, we can help. We know the entire Scala stack, and have applied it commercially for years &#8212; let us put that to work for your team. We know where the power is and where the potholes are, let us help you maximize the huge advantage that Scala development can be to your organization avoid the pitfalls.

### Got Java?

Is your development team using Java? Would you like to double that team&#8217;s effectiveness, or better?

Our principle, Michael Nash, has been helping Java teams transition to full effectiveness in Scala for the last five years, and before that he used Java since it was first introduced. He understands both ecosystems fully, and can leverage their synergy while bringing your team up to hyperproductivity with the most productive language ever: Scala.

Do you know your development team is falling behind, not doing as well as they could? Would you like to update your tools and technique, but don&#8217;t want to risk losing time or leaving your team behind?

We can help: JGlobal can help modernize your tools and get your team up to speed on them at the same time, ensuring you only speed up, never trading progress on projects for learning time.
