I&#8217;ve recently been doing a lot of my own projects in Scala, and, as many other developers have learned, have been finding it harder and harder to &#8220;revert&#8221; back to Java when Java is mandated for a specific project.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still use a lot of other languages, and languages come and go &#8211; I&#8217;ve learned not to get too attached. Yesterday (literally) I was coding in Ruby, today in Scala, Java and a lick of Python (well, Jython, technically).

Still, I find myself more and more reaching for Scala as my preferred weapon. So I started asking myself why that is, and thought I&#8217;d share the answers I&#8217;ve come up with so far. I&#8217;d be pleased to hear anyone other experiences as well, as I&#8217;m pretty sure this is not a complete list. It&#8217;s also not in any particular order, just the order I&#8217;ve remembered them.

**REPL**  
The REPL for Scala is a huge plus for me. I can quickly experiment with a few lines of code, either with or without the rest of my project on the classpath, and interactively work my way towards a solution. The closest in Java was by writing a throw-away unit test in my IDE, and that&#8217;s clumsy by comparison. The REPL is also an excellent learning tool, as anyone who&#8217;s used a language with one can attest.

**Actors**  
Actors are a library, not an in-built feature of Scala per se, but both &#8220;regular&#8221; Actors and alternatives such as Akka provide much of the power of languages like Erlang, while retaining all the other benefits of Scala. It&#8217;s difficult to grasp just how much power this can mean to a development project until you&#8217;ve worked with them a while, then they&#8217;re very hard to live without.

**Speed of Evolution**  
Scala evolves significantly faster than Java (or many other languages, for that matter). I won&#8217;t go into the many reasons why, they&#8217;ve been explored elsewhere, but this is a huge plus for me compared to the glacial pace of Java language evolution. 

**Open Source**  
Scala is actually open source. Not nearly or mostly or kinda or somewhat. Not it&#8217;s libraries, or everything except it&#8217;s mobile version, or all the bits someone doesn&#8217;t think they can make money off of. It&#8217;s released under a very open license, rather like a BSD license, with basically no restrictions. Here&#8217;s [the license itself][1], so have a read. It won&#8217;t take more than a moment.

By contrast, here&#8217;s the page discussing [the licenses for Java][2]. Bring lunch. And a lawyer, preferably.

**JVM and CLR**  
I don&#8217;t use the CLR, and in general despise everything ever produced by Microsoft, but it&#8217;s interesting and valuable in some situations to note that Scala doesn&#8217;t only run on the JVM, but also the CLR.

**Scripting**  
Ant is an obsolete build system and a worse cross-platform scripting language. Shell is OK, but showing it&#8217;s age a bit. Scala runs on every platform I care about, and is every bit as easy as shell to script with, so I&#8217;m finding I use it more and more for both quick-and-dirty scripts where I might have used shell before, and for things that will live longer, such as deployment and installation.

**Expressiveness**  
You can say a lot, quickly, with Scala. It&#8217;s not just terse and brief, but highly expressive. Examples abound out there, so I won&#8217;t waste space trying to prove it here, but in general I find I&#8217;m writing perhaps one fifth as many lines to do any given job when compared with Java. It&#8217;s at least on par with Ruby.

Not just speed of **writing** the code, although that&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s more about speed of **reading** the code. I can read good Scala and understand it significantly faster than I can wade through the equivalent code in Java. 

**Community**  
I can&#8217;t deny Java has a huge and helpful community as well, but Scala&#8217;s community compared to that of other &#8220;newcomer&#8221; languages is very diverse and helpful. It&#8217;s not a reason to pick Scala over Java, but it might be enough to pick Scala over, say, Python or Ruby, in some cases.

**Functional/OO Blend**  
Scala brings the capabilities of functional languages like Erlang, Haskell, and others to an approachable platform that lets you incorporate these concepts as you&#8217;re ready for them, as opposed to an &#8220;all or nothing&#8221; approach, as a Java programming moving to, say, OCaml might feel. It encourages immutability, but gently and easily, giving you time to learn the power of functional development, while allowing the many advantages of object-orientation to be retained at the same time. No other languages does this quite as well as Scala, in my view.

**Options**  
Had enough of NullPointerException ruining your day? Have a look at Option in Scala. It&#8217;s not a silver bullet, but it&#8217;s a heck of a lot better than Null <img src="http://jglobal.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon smile Why Scala?" class="wp-smiley" title="Why Scala?" /> 

**Productivity**  
The expressiveness of Scala means I can get a lot done, quickly, yet still have high-quality functional and performant code that I can read and maintain when I&#8217;m finished.  
Scala is approachable and [easy to learn][3], and you don&#8217;t have to learn all the fancy stuff it can do at first &#8211; you can just write what looks like extremely expressive Java, then get into the cool stuff as you go.

**Not Oracle**  
I have very little faith in Oracle&#8217;s stewardship of Java, to be honest, and I don&#8217;t think Oracle can sue me for using Scala. IANAL, however, and they may try <img src="http://jglobal.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon smile Why Scala?" class="wp-smiley" title="Why Scala?" /> 

One of my primary reasons for this worry is Oracle&#8217;s about-face on the issue of open source Java. Do a google on the &#8220;Apache Harmony Project&#8221; for the gory details.

**Traits**  
Multiple inheritance without the pain, basically. Interfaces and abstract classes with all the warts of both taken away. This is one area where Scala doesn&#8217;t just top Java, it blows it out of the water.

**Advanced Type System**  
Scala&#8217;s type system starts with the pure object-orientation principle (everything is an object, there are no primitives), and goes much, much further. Case classes alone are worth the price of admission, and they&#8217;re only the tip of the iceberg. See [High Wizardry in the Land of Scala][4] for a taste of what the type system in Scala can do.

**Java compatability**  
Conversely, Java itself is a reason for my preference for Scala. Instead of Ruby or Haskell or OCaml, if I choose Scala I basically get the entire JVM ecosystem available to me &#8211; and that&#8217;s a lot. I get OSGi, JDBC, all the drivers for every SQL and NoSQL database you&#8217;ve every heard &#8211; the works. Except with a language that&#8217;s decades ahead of plain Java in other areas.

**Tool support**  
Not compared to Java, which of course has amazing tool support, but tool support for Scala is now up to the point where it&#8217;s quite acceptable, even good in some places. I prefer IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin, but good support also exists for Scala now in most of the major IDEs, and more come along every day, it seems.

**Collections**  
Scala&#8217;s collection classes are a long way ahead of Java&#8217;s, even when you add libraries like Google Collections to Java, and allow you an easy way to go back and forth to existing Java libraries, especially in Scala 2.8. 

**DSLs**  
Scala&#8217;s flexible syntax makes internal DSLs almost trivial, a huge boon when working with many frameworks. My own little DSL for Vaadin UI development puts a whole new aspect on creating UI&#8217;s, I&#8217;ve found, and tools like Squeryl and others put this DSL capability to incredible use, things that just aren&#8217;t easily possible in Java.
