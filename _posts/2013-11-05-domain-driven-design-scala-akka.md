Vaughn Vernon has authored a <a href="https://vaughnvernon.co/?p=770" target="_new">great article on using Domain-Driven Design with Scala and Akka.</a> (And [a followup article here][1])

It adds a unique approach that I haven&#8217;t tried (yet!) to my experiences doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" target="_new">Domain-Driven</a> design and <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture" target="_new">Ports and Adapters</a> with Scala and Akka, but echoes my belief that the Scala platform is an excellent tool for DDD, and that DDD has a great deal to offer when making applications more coherent and maintainable.

I can also recommend his book, *Implementing Domain-Driven design*, as an excellent adjunct to the classic *Domain-Driven Design* by Eric Evans.
