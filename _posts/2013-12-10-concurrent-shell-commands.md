I recently came across a great article that reminded me about a utility I have used many times in the past, but forgotten about recently. It&#8217;s handy enough that I thought I&#8217;d better share&#8230;

The utility is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/" target="_new">GNU Parallel</a>, and it&#8217;s available for just about every Unix-like OS in one form or another.

Here&#8217;s the article that reminded me about it, it gives some excellent examples of putting Parallel to use:
