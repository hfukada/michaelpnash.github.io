In our series of articles about Emacs Power for Scala development, our next area to explore is the actual editing &#8211; where Emacs really shines. 

You might want to start with the classic <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/" target="_new">Guided Tour of Emacs</a>

In this video we&#8217;ll explore editing Scala code, as well as all the refactoring and completion support that Ensime brings to the process.

I again recommend opening the video up to full screen mode to see the text most clearly.



You can find the key-bindings referred to in the video here: <a href="http://jglobal.com/emacs-for-scala-keybindings/" target="_new">Emacs for Scala Keybindings</a>

Our first book comes out soon, &#8220;Principles and Practices of Software Craftsmanship&#8221;! [Sign up for our newsletter][1] to be notified when the free sample chapter is available!
