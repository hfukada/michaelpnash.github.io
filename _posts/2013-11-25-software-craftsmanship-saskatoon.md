One of the core principles of software craftsmanship is to work together to improve our whole industry, and in the process, improve ourselves and our skills.

The many different ways that this can happen are greatly multiplied if we learn together with others, as I&#8217;ve recently been reminded by <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org/" target="_new">SCNA</a> and <a href="http://barcampsaskatoon.org/" target="_new">BarCamp Saskatoon</a>.

As a result, I&#8217;ve suggested a software craftsmanship in-person group here in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, so that interested developers can have an opportunity to connect and learn from each other, and find ways to enhance our craft together.

I&#8217;ve created a <a href="http://groupspaces.com/SoftwareCraftsmanshipSaskatoon/" target="_new">groupspaces page for the group here</a>, and if you&#8217;re in the area, I invite you to sign up and/or come along to our first meeting.

I don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going to go, I&#8217;m just lighting the match, but I know there are some very dedicated professionals in the city, and I look forward to the chance to network with them and learn from them.

Our first meeting is set for the 1st of December at 1418 College Drive &#8211; check the groupspaces site above for the most current info, though, and directions to the venue.

I hope to see you there!
