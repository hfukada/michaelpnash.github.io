In followup to my [previous post][1], I&#8217;ve [published a project][2] with my full .emacs.d directory, as well as a &#8220;cheat sheet&#8221; of Key bindings, for anyone who is having a go at using Ensime and Emacs for Scala development.

There are still many things I wished worked better (parameter assistance/completion, anyone?), but it&#8217;s not too bad at all.

A few months in now, I still find myself going back to IntelliJ IDEA (with the Scala plugin, of course), and it gets steadily better over time as well, but annoyances of IntelliJ and advantages of Emacs keep me switching. Perhaps eventually I&#8217;ll settle on one or the other, but nothing wrong with variety either.

Feel free to contribute if you have any enhancements!
