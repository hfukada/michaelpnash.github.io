Wow &#8211; that was quick.

[Oracle buys Sun][1]

I&#8217;m hoping for great things from this. Oracle generally have a pretty good track record in the software business, will be interesting to see what it means for their partnership with HP, though, now that they own their own hardware company as well.

Exciting times we live in!
