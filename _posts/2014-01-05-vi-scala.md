The holidays have given me a (small) chance to catch up on some of my experimenting, and I&#8217;ve come across a combination that might be useful to other Scala-ites out there (and people who edit code in general).

Over time, I&#8217;ve found I tend to move away from &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; and &#8220;heavy&#8221; solutions (even though those solutions often bring a lot of benefit), and look more for lightweight approaches and tools. I&#8217;ll leave the reason why for another post, but if you keep going in the lightweight direction on editors and IDEs, you can&#8217;t get a whole lot lighter-weight than the venerable vi (or vim, as it&#8217;s modern counterpart is actually called).

Even though I am also an emacs aficionado (yes, I&#8217;m bi-editorial, if that&#8217;s a word), I can&#8217;t dispute the speed and convenience of vi. It fast &#8211; very fast, and available on just about every platform worth mentioning in one form or another, usually by default.

The things I find it&#8217;s lacking that I actually need in an editor are, it turns out, readily available, and the addition takes vi from the quick editor I grab to make a simple change into an editor I can use for serious hardcode development on major projects. In my case, my go-to language is Scala, so I&#8217;ve tuned it for that language, but as a general-purpose editor (one of the most general, in fact), vi is perfectly capable of editing just about anything you can put in a text file (including Unicode, as it turns out!)

If you&#8217;ve never seen it, do yourself a favour and go <a href="http://vimeo.com/6999927" target="_new">watch Derek Wyatt&#8217;s video introduction to Vim</a>. The rest of his posts and videos are also excellent, and I&#8217;ve swiped much of my own setup from his <img src="http://jglobal.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon smile Vi for Scala" class="wp-smiley" title="Vi for Scala" />
