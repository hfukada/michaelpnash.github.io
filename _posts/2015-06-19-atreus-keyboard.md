I will admit, I'm a bit of a keyboard nut. I must have thirty keyboards - I haven't counted recently, but it's a lot.

So why on earth would I buy yet another keyboard?

There are a number of reasons....

I learn more about keyboards over time. My perfect keyboard way back when was the keyboard that came with the DEC VT100 dumb terminal.

Later I developed a great appreciation for the IBM Model M keyboard, and, much later, it's successor, the Unicomp.

The primary advantage of the model M is it's switches: mechanical keyboards are, for the advanced typist, the only way to go.

In more recent years, though, other excellent mechanical switches have become available - some that even rival the old Model M's switches, such
as the Cherry MX switches.

I've also learned that the model M layout has one substantial flaw - it has a numeric keypad. There's nothing wrong with a keypad in and of itself, but
it increases the reach distance to the mouse for us right-handers just a little bit more.

I don't use a mouse much, but modern UIs sometimes require it, and I have no desire to damage my shoulder and arm any more than I already
have by 35+ years behind a keyboard.

This began a long quest to find a mechanical keyboard that had no numeric keypad, but that used good mechanical switches.

## The Atreus

I'll document the quest in another post, but here I'd like to talk about one contender: [The Atreus keyboard](http://atreus.technomancy.us/).

The Atreus is not a final product - it's a kit. Although I was an avid amateur radio operator back in my youth, I haven't picked up a 
soldering iron in a long time, so I was a little nervous about a kit. After some consideration, though, I took the plunge.

### The Kit
The Atreus arrived in short order, and I opened the box to find a collection of parts reminiscient of the old Heathkit radio kits.

In a fine piece of efficency, one of the daughterboards for the Atreus uses the legs (wires) clipped from another component to create connectors. 
A fairly delicate bit of soldering attaches these legs to the daughterboard - this was maybe the hardest part of the build.

After that, each of the switches has to be soldered into position, one at a time...

Putting on the keycaps...

All the keycaps on.

## Hands-On Use

One thing I've learned about ergonomic keyboards - you have to be prepared to learn the layout.
Over the years, my fingers have learned the standard QUERTY layout, and, more specifically, the 101-key layout of the model M.
Every time I vary from that layout, I have to be prepared for a period of adjustment, ranging from a few days to ... well, in some cases, never.

There are a few keyboards I have whose layout I've never fully mastered to the point where it's sufficiently automatic that I recover my
typing speed.

Interestingly, this problem is almost worse if you're a touch typist, which I am.
