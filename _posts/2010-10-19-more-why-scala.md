I had planned this past weekend to attend a local conference and present a quick discussion on &#8220;Why Scala?&#8221;, or reasons why the Scala language might be worth the attention and time of any serious student of the programming craft.

Unfortunately, I ended up unable to attend, but I thought I&#8217;d post a link to my Prezi (a new style of presentation editor) here, in case anyone can make use of it.

Here&#8217;s the link: <http://prezi.com/fb0vqbuqk33a/why-scala/>

Feel free to make use of all or part of it as you see fit. Hopefully another opportunity will come up to try it out and refine it to an interested group in the future.
