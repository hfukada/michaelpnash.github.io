Continuing the series of posts exploring applying the power of Emacs to Scala development, let&#8217;s look at how we can use Scala&#8217;s REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).

Having a REPL is one of the things that is often overlooked, but is one of the most powerful capabilities of a language if you put it to good use.

In this video, we show how to launch SBT from within a Scala project in Emacs, and what advantages that brings.

We also have a look at launching the REPL from within Emacs, and having access to all the classes in our project.

I again recommend opening the video up to full screen mode to see the text most clearly.
