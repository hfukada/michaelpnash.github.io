Continuing the series of posts exploring applying the power of Emacs to Scala development, this edition explores finding and running tests for your Scala classes from within Emacs.

The Emacs-for-Scala project has a couple of custom functions that make jumping to the test file corresponding to a current file easy, and launching and running SBT from within a test file easy as well. In this short video we&#8217;ll see how to do both of these.

I again recommend opening the video up to full screen mode to see the text most clearly.
