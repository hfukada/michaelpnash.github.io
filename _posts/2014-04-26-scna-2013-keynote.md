Back near the end of last year (November, to be exact), the 2013 Software Craftsmanship North America conference took place, in Chicago.

I was lucky enough to attend this one, and I hope to make it a regular practice finally.

After the conference, a number of the talks were available in video format online for everyone who couldn&#8217;t make it to enjoy, and for those of us who did make it to re-enjoy.

One disappointment, though, was that for some time the keynote address, given by Robert &#8220;Uncle Bob&#8221; Martin, wasn&#8217;t available. 

I&#8217;m pleased to see that was rectified, though, and even though the audio isn&#8217;t perfect, Uncle Bob&#8217;s keynote is a &#8220;must see&#8221; if you haven&#8217;t already.

As always, his words are well worth considering carefully.

Enjoy!
