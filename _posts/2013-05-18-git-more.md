Git is a powerful system, but too many developers use it like a souped-up version of SVN. It&#8217;s so much more, that it&#8217;s not really quite fair to compare the two in some ways.

If you want to know the details, there are plenty of excellent discussions about why it is a horse of an entirely different color, such as <a href="http://git-scm.com/about" target="_new">this one for details</a>, <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/why-you-should-switch-from-subversion-to-git" target="_new">this one specifically comparing it to Subversion</a>, or this intensive <a href="http://thkoch2001.github.io/whygitisbetter/" target="_new">diagram comparing git to &#8211; well &#8211; everything else!</a>

But let&#8217;s assume you&#8217;re sold already &#8211; you know Git is good, but you aren&#8217;t sure how to ramp up your git skills.

This one isn&#8217;t hard &#8211; I&#8217;d recommend starting with the excellent <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/" target="_new">Git Immersion</a>. Work your way all the way through it &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t take long, and you are well on your way to having git under your belt by the end, ready to do all the basics.

Then I&#8217;d move on to the <a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1" target="_new">fully interactive challenges here</a>, where you&#8217;ll review the basics from a different perspective, and up your game a notch as well.

Now you&#8217;re definitely at a nice Git 101 level, but you&#8217;re just beginning to *taste* the true power of Git&#8230;

Take it a bit further now with <a href="http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/" target="_new">Git Branching</a>, and learn why frictionless branching is where git really starts to shine. Sure, you can branch in SVN, but not like this!

## Ramping Up

When you&#8217;re read to learn the rest of Git, move on with <a href="http://gitready.com/" target="_new">Git Ready.</a>

By now you&#8217;ll be looking for reference material for some of the less commonly used options and commands, and <a href="http://gitref.org/" target="_new">here is an excellent one.</a>

## Books

Once you&#8217;re at this point with Git, you might want to actually work your way through some of the Git books. Two I can suggest right away are listed below:
