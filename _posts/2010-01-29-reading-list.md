We&#8217;ve got a number of high-priority tasks going on at work right now, so I&#8217;ve not had time to post about all the interesting tech we&#8217;re using. I have kept up on my reading, though, and I thought I&#8217;d share a few links to articles and sites I&#8217;ve found very helpful in the last while. We will soon return to our irregularly unscheduled postings <img src="http://jglobal.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon smile Reading List" class="wp-smiley" title="Reading List" />
