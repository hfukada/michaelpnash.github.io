In continuation with our series of posts about applying the power of Emacs to Scala development, a critical area for any set of development tools is navigation.

My toolkit for Scala development with Emacs includes dirtree, dired (native to Emacs) and Ensime, not to mention a few extra customizations.

In this video we&#8217;ll explore all the different ways you can navigate between files and directories, and within Scala files, using Emacs

I again recommend opening the video up to full screen mode to see the text most clearly.

You can find the key-bindings referred to in the video here: <a href="http://jglobal.com/emacs-for-scala-keybindings/" target="_new">Emacs for Scala Keybindings</a>
