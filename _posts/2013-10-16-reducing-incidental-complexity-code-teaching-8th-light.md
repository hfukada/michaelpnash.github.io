Ryan Verner recently posted on the <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/" target="_new">8th Light</a> blog an excellent article about why *incidental complexity* in our code is harmful, followed by an excellent series of straightforward suggestions about how to both eliminate and avoid it.

Highly recommended:
