How can you **not** love a language that has a keyboard layout like this? 

![KeyboardInt A+ Fun!][1]

Seriously, though, I&#8217;ve found a certain fascination in APL ever since I first saw it back in &#8230; well, a number of years ago. [A+][2], a new language based in part on good &#8216;ole APL, promises to be just as fascinating, but in a more modern and up-to-date way.

I remember having to find a special terminal (yes, a terminal) that had the funky APL keyboard caps, then picking out a program, one special character at a time. The good new was that in about 5 characters (including a couple of overtyped things that looked like squashed bugs), my program was finished &#8211; and doing real work. That&#8217;s the amazing thing about APL, and it&#8217;s modern ancestor A+ &#8211; the expressiveness is just amazing.

I&#8217;d show you some code samples, but you need a special font to read them, so you&#8217;ll just have to go have a look around on the [A+ site][2].

Readability isn&#8217;t quite as scary as you might think at first, either, at least once you know what all those funny dead-bug symbols mean, as there&#8217;s not that many of them in a typical program. There&#8217;s also an ASCII mode, for the less adventurous.

I&#8217;ve yet to really give A+ a proper workout, but I have to say I&#8217;m looking forward to referring to my key-cap printout and taking it out for a spin!
