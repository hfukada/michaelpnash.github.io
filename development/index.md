We don&#8217;t *only* <a href="/training" target="_new">teach</a>, we ***do***.

Let us apply our expertise to your custom software needs.

We can help you determine if you need a custom application, or if something already build can be adapted, and then help you put it to work. We&#8217;re experts in open-source software, and know about hundreds of high-quality applications and libraries we can use to maximize your development dollars.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Need a team to build an application, service, web-app or utility for you?

Let us put our expert team of software craftsmen to work for your project.

Our developers can work directly with your company through a series of short, efficient iterations, utilizing continuous delivery &#8211; you never wonder what&#8217;s going on, you see it, minute by minute, day by day.

No project is too small, and with our network of partners, no project is too big. We offer both time-based and project-based pricing, and we guarantee our work &#8211; we&#8217;re not satisfied until you are satisfied.

See our portfolio and vertical market areas of expertise, and contact us to get a quick and reliable estimate for your project.

      We supply quality development services on either a weekly basis or a project basis.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In either case, we produce a detailed estimate for each stage of work, providing a best case, expected case, worst case range, so you know exactly what you&#8217;re getting into.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Out estimate is a <i>commitment</i>, one we stand behind so much that we&#8217;re happy to provide project-basis billing: you pay a fixed up-front price for a specific piece of functionality, delivered and working, with a 100% money-back guarantee. No surprises, no overruns.

      Although we <i>can</i> come to you of course, it&#8217;s not usually necessary, and you can save significant amounts by taking advantage of our expertise in remote development. We know working remotely is not the same as being there in person &#8211; often it&#8217;s better &#8211; but it&#8217;s important that you work with someone whose done it before, and knows the techniques and approaches for remote work &#8211; and we do.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We employ a fully agile process to our development. When we start your project, we start with what we call a &#8220;walking skeleton&#8221;, a functioning and deployed <i>real</i> version of your system, just without the features. Then we put the meat on the bones using continuous integration and delivery, with an automated build system and a full suite of tests, so you can see progress every day, and get value immediately. You&#8217;ve got access to your code at any time, and the running application is constantly reviewed to make sure we&#8217;re on track until final delivery.

    <p>
      If you don&#8217;t want to host your finished application yourself, we can arrange cloud hosting of virtually any application, large or small, with advanced monitoring to ensure your application stays available!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We have experience hosting applications in many different environments, including AWS, Linode, Rackspace, Heroku, and others, and can help you choose where the right home is for your applications.
